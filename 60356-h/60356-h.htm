<h3>PRELIMINARY</h3>

<div class="drop">
<img class="cap" src="images/dropf.jpg" alt="F" width="81" height="82"
 /><p class="cap">FROM my earliest recollections, and
up to the ripe age of fifty-three, I
had been an active and diligent
worker in the world. This sounds absurd;
but having almost no toys except such as I
could manufacture, my first plays were but
the outdoor work of active men and women
on a small scale. Born with an inveterate
opposition to staying in the house, I very
early learned to use a carpenter’s kit and a
gardener’s tools, and followed in my mimic
way the occupations of the poulterer and the
farmer, working my little field with a wooden
plow of my own making, and felling saplings
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with an ax rigged up from the old iron of the
wagon-shop. Living in the country, far from
the artificial restraints and conventions by
which most girls are hedged from the activities
that would develop a good physique, and
endowed with the companionship of a mother
who let me have my own sweet will, I “ran
wild” until my sixteenth birthday, when the
hampering long skirts were brought, with
their accompanying corset and high heels;
my hair was clubbed up with pins, and I remember
writing in my journal, in the first
heartbreak of a young human colt taken from
its pleasant pasture, “Altogether, I recognize
that my occupation is gone.”</p>
</div>

<p>From that time on I always realized and
was obedient to the limitations thus imposed,
though in my heart of hearts I felt their unwisdom
even more than their injustice. My
work then changed from my beloved and
breezy outdoor world to the indoor realm of
study, teaching, writing, speaking, and went
on almost without a break or pain until my
<a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fifty-third year, when the loss of my mother
accentuated the strain of this long period in
which mental and physical life were out of
balance, and I fell into a mild form of what
is called nerve-wear by the patient and nervous
prostration by the lookers-on. Thus
ruthlessly thrown out of the usual lines of
reaction on my environment, and sighing for
new worlds to conquer, I determined that I
would learn the bicycle.</p>

<p>An English naval officer had said to me,
after learning it himself, “You women have
no idea of the new realm of happiness which
the bicycle has opened to us men.” Already I
knew well enough that tens of thousands who
could never afford to own, feed, and stable
a horse, had by this bright invention enjoyed
the swiftness of motion which is perhaps the
most fascinating feature of material life, the
charm of a wide outlook upon the natural
world, and that sense of mastery which is
probably the greatest attraction in horseback-riding.
But the steed that never tires, and is
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“mettlesome” in the fullest sense of the
word, is full of tricks and capers, and to hold
his head steady and make him prance to suit
you is no small accomplishment. I had often
mentioned in my temperance writings that
the bicycle was perhaps our strongest ally
in winning young men away from public-houses,
because it afforded them a pleasure
far more enduring, and an exhilaration as
much more delightful as the natural is than
the unnatural. From my observation of my
own brother and hundreds of young men
who have been my pupils, I have always
held that a boy’s heart is not set in him to
do evil any more than a girl’s, and that the
reason our young men fall into evil ways is
largely because we have not had the wit and
wisdom to provide them with amusements
suited to their joyous youth, by means of
which they could invest their superabundant
animal spirits in ways that should harm no
one and help themselves to the best development
and the cleanliest ways of living. So
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as a temperance reformer I always felt a
strong attraction toward the bicycle, because
it is the vehicle of so much harmless pleasure,
and because the skill required in handling it
obliges those who mount to keep clear heads
and steady hands. Nor could I see a reason
in the world why a woman should not ride
the silent steed so swift and blithesome. I
knew perfectly well that when, some ten or
fifteen years ago, Miss Bertha von Hillern, a
young German artist in America, took it into
her head to give exhibitions of her skill in
riding the bicycle she was thought by some
to be a sort of semi-monster; and liberal as
our people are in their views of what a
woman may undertake, I should certainly
have felt compromised, at that remote and
benighted period, by going to see her ride,
not because there was any harm in it, but
solely because of what we call in homely
phrase “the speech of people.” But behold!
it was long ago conceded that women might
ride the tricycle—indeed, one had been
<a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>presented to me by my friend Colonel Pope, of
Boston, a famous manufacturer of these swift
roadsters, as far back as 1886; and I had
swung around the garden-paths upon its saddle
a few minutes every evening when work
was over at my Rest Cottage home. I had
even hoped to give an impetus among conservative
women to this new line of physical
development and outdoor happiness; but
that is quite another story and will come in
later. Suffice it for the present that it did
me good, as it doth the upright in heart, to
notice recently that the Princesses Louise and
Beatrice both ride the tricycle at Balmoral; for
I know that with the great mass of feminine
humanity this precedent will have exceeding
weight—and where the tricycle prophesies
the bicycle shall ere long preach the gospel
of outdoors.</p>

<p>For we are all unconsciously the slaves of
public opinion. When the hansom first came
on London streets no woman having regard
to her social state and standing would have
dreamed of entering one of these pavement
<a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>gondolas unless accompanied by a gentleman
as her escort. But in course of time a few
women, of stronger individuality than the
average, ventured to go unattended; later
on, use wore off the glamour of the traditions
which said that women must not go alone,
and now none but an imbecile would hold
herself to any such observance.</p>

<p>A trip around the world by a young woman
would have been regarded a quarter of
a century ago as equivalent to social outlawry;
but now young women of the highest
character and talent are employed by leading
journals to whip around the world “on time,”
and one has done so in seventy-three, another
in seventy-four days, while the young
women recently sent out by an Edinburgh
newspaper will no doubt considerably contract
these figures.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned, Fräulein von Hillern
is the first woman, so far as I know, who ever
rode a bicycle, and for this she was considered
to be one of those persons who classified
nowhere, and who could not do so except to
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
the injury of the feminine guild with which
they were connected before they “stepped
out”; but now, in France, for a woman to
ride a bicycle is not only “good form,” but
the current craze among the aristocracy.</p>

<p>Since Balaam’s beast there has been but
little authentic talking done by the four-footed;
but that is no reason why the two-wheeled
should not speak its mind, and the
first utterance I have to chronicle in the softly
flowing vocables of my bicycle is to the following
purport. I heard it as we trundled off
down the Priory incline at the suburban home
of Lady Henry Somerset, Reigate, England;
it said: “Behold, I do not fail you; I am not
a skittish beastie, but a sober, well-conducted
roadster. I did not ask you to mount or
drive, but since you have done so you must
now learn the laws of balance and exploitation.
I did not invent these laws, but I have been
built conformably to them, and you must
suit yourself to the unchanging regulations of
gravity, general and specific, as illustrated in
<a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
me. Strange as the paradox may seem, you
will do this best by not trying to do it at all.
You must make up what you are pleased to
call your mind—make it up speedily, or you
will be cast in yonder mud-puddle, and no
blame to me and no thanks to yourself. Two
things must occupy your thinking powers to
the exclusion of every other thing: first, the
goal; and, second, the momentum requisite
to reach it. Do not look down like an imbecile
upon the steering-wheel in front of
you—that would be about as wise as for a
nauseated voyager to keep his optical instruments
fixed upon the rolling waves. It is
the curse of life that nearly every one looks
down. But the microscope will never set
you free; you must glue your eyes to the
telescope for ever and a day. Look up and
off and on and out; get forehead and foot
into line, the latter acting as a rhythmic spur
in the flanks of your equilibriated equine; so
shall you win, and that right speedily.</p>

<p>“It was divinely said that the kingdom of
<a name="png.020" id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
God is within you. Some make a mysticism
of this declaration, but it is hard common
sense; for the lesson you will learn from me is
this: every kingdom over which we reign must
be first formed within us on what the psychic
people call the ‘astral plane,’ but what I as a
bicycle look upon as the common parade-ground
of individual thought.”</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>THE PROCESS</h3>

<p>Courtiers wittily say that horseback riding
is the only thing in which a prince is apt to
excel, for the reason that the horse never
flatters and would as soon throw him as if he
were a groom. Therefore it is only by actually
mastering the art of riding that a prince
can hold his place with the noblest of the
four-footed animals.</p>

<p>Happily there is now another locomotive
contrivance which is no flatterer, and which
peasant and prince must master, if they do
this at all, by the democratic route of honest
hard work. Well will it be for rulers when
<a name="png.021" id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
the tough old Yorkshire proverb applies to
them as strictly as to the lowest of their subjects:
“<cite>It’s dogged as does it.</cite>” We all know
the old saying, “Fire is a good servant, but
a bad master.” This is equally true of the
bicycle: if you give it an inch—nay, a hair—it
will take an ell—nay, an evolution—and you a
contusion, or, like enough, a perforated kneecap.</p>

<p>Not a single friend encouraged me to learn
the bicycle except an active-minded young
school-teacher, Miss Luther, of my hometown,
Evanston, who came several times with
her wheel and gave me lessons. I also took
a few lessons in a stuffy, semi-subterranean
gallery in Chicago. But at fifty-three I was
at more disadvantage than most people, for
not only had I the impedimenta that result
from the unnatural style of dress, but I also
suffered from the sedentary habits of a lifetime.
And then that small world (which is
our real one) of those who loved me best,
and who considered themselves largely
<a name="png.022" id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
responsible for my every-day methods of life,
did not encourage me, but in their affectionate
solicitude—and with abundant reason—thought
I should “break my bones” and
“spoil my future.” It must be said, however,
to their everlasting praise, that they
opposed no objection when they saw that
my will was firmly set to do this thing; on
the contrary, they put me in the way of
carrying out my purpose, and lent to my
laborious lessons the light of their countenances
reconciled. Actions speak so much
louder than words that I here set before you
what may be called a feminine bicycler’s first
position—at least it was mine.</p>

<p>Given a safety-bicycle—pneumatic tires
and all the rest of it which renders the pneumatic
safety the only safe Bucephalus—the
gearing carefully wired in so that we shall
not be entangled. “Woe is me!” was my
first exclamation, naturally enough interpreted
by my outriders “Whoa is me,” and
<a name="png.025" id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>they “whoaed”—indeed, we did little else
but “check up.”</p>

<p>(Just here let me interpolate: Learn on
a low machine, but “fly high” when once
you have mastered it, as you have much
more power over the wheels and can get up
better speed with a less expenditure of force
when you are above the instrument than
when you are at the back of it. And remember
this is as true of the world as of the
wheel.)</p>

<p>The order of evolution was something like
this: First, three young Englishmen, all
strong-armed and accomplished bicyclers,
held the machine in place while I climbed
timidly into the saddle. Second, two well-disposed
young women put in all the power
they had, until they grew red in the face, offsetting
each other’s pressure on the cross-bar
and thus maintaining the equipoise to which
I was unequal. Third, one walked beside
me, steadying the ark as best she could by
<a name="png.026" id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>holding the center of the deadly cross-bar, to
let go whose handles meant chaos and collapse.
After this I was able to hold my own
if I had the moral support of my kind trainers,
and it passed into a proverb among them, the
short emphatic word of command I gave
them at every few turns of the wheel: “Let
go, but stand by.” Still later everything
was learned—how to sit, how to pedal, how
to turn, how to dismount; but alas! how to
vault into the saddle I found not; that was
the coveted power that lingered long and
would not yield itself.</p>

<p>That which caused the many failures I had
in learning the bicycle had caused me failures
in life; namely, a certain fearful looking for
of judgment; a too vivid realization of the
uncertainty of everything about me; an underlying
doubt—at once, however (and this is
all that saved me), matched and overcome by
the determination not to give in to it.</p>

<p>The best gains that we make come to us
after an interval of rest which follows
<a name="png.027" id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>strenuous endeavor. Having, as I hoped, mastered
the rudiments of bicycling, I went away
to Germany and for a fortnight did not even
see the winsome wheel. Returning, I had
the horse brought round, and mounted with
no little trepidation, being assisted by one
of my faithful guides; but behold! I found
that in advancing, turning, and descending I
was much more at home than when I had
last exercised that new intelligence in the
muscles which had been the result of repetitions
resolutely attempted and practised long.</p>

<p>Another thing I found is that we carry in
the mind a picture of the road; and if it is
humpy by reason of pebbles, even if we steer
clear of them, we can by no means skim along
as happily as when its smoothness facilitates
the pleasing impression on the retina; indeed,
the whole science and practice of the bicycle
is “in your eye” and in your will; the rest
is mere manipulation.</p>

<p>As I have said, in many curious particulars
the bicycle is like the world.  When it had
<a name="png.028" id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>thrown me painfully once (which was the
extent of my downfalls during the entire process
of learning, and did not prevent me from
resuming my place on the back of the treacherous
creature a few minutes afterward), and
more especially when it threw one of my
dearest friends, hurting her knee so that it
was painful for a month, then for a time
Gladys had gladsome ways for me no longer,
but seemed the embodiment of misfortune
and dread. Even so the world has often
seemed in hours of darkness and despondency;
its iron mechanism, its pitiless grind,
its swift, silent, on-rolling gait have oppressed
to pathos, if not to melancholy. Good health
and plenty of oxygenated air have promptly
restored the equilibrium. But how many a
fine spirit, to finest issues touched, has been
worn and shredded by the world’s mill until
in desperation it flung itself away. We can
easily carp at those who quit the crowded
race-course without so much as saying “By
your leave”; but “let him that thinketh he
<a name="png.029" id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>standeth take heed lest he fall.” We owe it
to nature, to nurture, to our environments,
and, most of all, to our faith in God, that we,
too, do not cry, like so many gentle hearts less
brave and sturdy, “Anywhere, anywhere, out
of the world.”</p>

<p>Gradually, item by item, I learned the location
of every screw and spring, spoke and
tire, and every beam and bearing that went
to make up Gladys. This was not the lesson
of a day, but of many days and weeks, and it
had to be learned before we could get on
well together. To my mind the infelicities
of which we see so much in life grow out of
lack of time and patience thus to study and
adjust the natures that have agreed in the
sight of God and man to stand by one another
to the last. They will not take the pains, they
have not enough specific gravity, to balance
themselves in their new environment. Indeed,
I found a whole philosophy of life in the
wooing and the winning of my bicycle.</p>

<p>Just as a strong and skilful swimmer takes
<a name="png.030" id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the waves, so the bicycler must learn to take
such waves of mental impression as the passing
of a gigantic hay-wagon, the sudden obtrusion
of black cattle with wide-branching
horns, the rattling pace of high-stepping
steeds, or even the swift transit of a railway-train.
At first she will be upset by the apparition
of the smallest poodle, and not until
she has attained a wide experience will she
hold herself steady in presence of the critical
eyes of a coach-and-four. But all this is a
part of that equilibration of thought and action
by which we conquer the universe in
conquering ourselves.</p>

<p>I finally concluded that all failure was from
a wobbling will rather than a wobbling wheel.
I felt that indeed the will is the wheel of the
mind—its perpetual motion having been
learned when the morning stars sang together.
When the wheel of the mind went
well then the rubber wheel hummed merrily;
but specters of the mind there are as well as
of the wheel. In the aggregate of perception
<a name="png.031" id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>concerning which we have reflected and
from which we have deduced our generalizations
upon the world without, within, above,
there are so many ghastly and fantastical
images that they must obtrude themselves
at certain intervals, like filmy bits of glass
in the turn of the kaleidoscope. Probably
every accident of which I had heard or read
in my half-century tinged the uncertainty
that by the correlation of forces passed over
into the tremor that I felt when we began to
round the terminus bend of the broad Priory
walk. And who shall say by what original
energy the mind forced itself at once from
the contemplation of disaster and thrust into
the very movement of the foot on the pedal
a concept of vigor, safety, and success? I
began to feel that myself plus the bicycle
equaled myself plus the world, upon whose
spinning-wheel we must all learn to ride, or
fall into the sluiceways of oblivion and despair.
That which made me succeed with the bicycle
was precisely what had gained me a measure
<a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of success in life—it was the hardihood of
spirit that led me to begin, the persistence of
will that held me to my task, and the patience
that was willing to begin again when the last
stroke had failed. And so I found high
moral uses in the bicycle and can commend
it as a teacher without pulpit or creed. He
who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing
over my experience, she who succeeds in
gaining the mastery of such an animal as
Gladys, will gain the mastery of life, and by
exactly the same methods and characteristics.</p>

<p>One of the first things I learned was that
unless a forward impetus were given within
well-defined intervals, away we went into the
gutter, rider and steed. And I said to myself:
“It is the same with all reforms: sometimes
they seem to lag, then they barely
balance, then they begin to oscillate as if
they would lose the track and tumble to one
side; but all they need is a new impetus at
the right moment on the right angle, and
<a name="png.035" id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>away they go again as merrily as if they had
never threatened to stop at all.”</p>

<div class="illo">
<a name="png.034" id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29a<span class="ns">]<br

</div>

<p>On the Castle terrace we went through a
long, narrow curve in a turret to seek a
broader esplanade. As we approached it I
felt wrought up in my mind, a little uncertain
in my motions; and for that reason, on a
small scale, my quick imagination put before
me pictures of a “standing from under” on
the part of the machine and damaging bruises
against the pitiless walls. But with a little
unobtrusive guiding by one who knew better
than I how to do it we soon came out of the
dim passage on to the broad, bright terrace
we sought, and in an instant my fears were
as much left behind as if I had not had them.
So it will be, I think, I hope—nay, I believe—when,
children that we are, we tremble on
the brink and fear to launch away; but we
shall find that death is only a bend in the
river of life that sets the current heavenward.</p>

<p>One afternoon, on the terrace at Eastnor
Castle—the most delightful bicycle gallery I
<a name="png.036" id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>have found anywhere—I fell to talking with
a young companion about New-Year resolutions.
It was just before Christmas, but the
sky was of that moist blue that England only
knows, and the earth almost steamy in the
mild sunshine, while the soft outline of the
famous Malvern Hills was restful as the little
lake just at our feet, where swans were sailing
or anchoring according to their fancy.</p>

<p>One of us said: “I have already chosen
my motto for 1894, and it is this, from a
teacher who so often said to her pupils, when
meeting them in corridor or recitation-room,
‘I have heard something nice about you,’
that it passed into a proverb in the school.
Now I have determined that my mental attitude
toward everybody shall be the same that
these words indicate. The meaning is identical
with that of the inscription on the fireplace
in my den at home—‘Let something
good be said.’ I remember mentioning to
a literary friend that this was what I had
chosen, and so far was he from perceiving
<a name="png.037" id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>my intention that he sarcastically remarked,
‘Are you then afraid that people will say
dull things unless you set this rule before
them?’ But my thought then was as it is
now, that we should apply in our discussions
of people and things the rule laid down by
Coleridge, namely, ‘Look for the good in
everything that you behold and every person,
but do not decline to see the defects if
they are there, and to refer to them.’”</p>

<p>“That is an excellent motto,” brightly replied
the other, “but if we followed it life
would not be nearly so amusing as it is now.
I have several friends whose rule is never to
say any harm of anybody, and to my mind
this cripples their development, for the tendency
of such a method is to dull one’s powers
of discrimination.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the first speaker, “would not
a medium course be better?—such a one,
for instance, as my motto suggests. This
would not involve keeping silence about the
faults of persons and things, but would
<a name="png.038" id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>develop that cheerful atmosphere which helps
to smooth the rough edges of life, and at the
same time does not destroy the critical faculty,
because you are to tell the truth and the whole
truth concerning those around you, whereas
the common custom is to speak much of defects
and little or not at all of merits.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply, “but it is not half
so entertaining to speak of virtues as of faults,
especially in this country; if you don’t criticize
you can hardly talk at all, because the
English dwell a great deal on what we in
America call ‘the selvage side’ of things.”</p>

<p>“Have you, then, noticed this as a national
peculiarity after ten years of observation?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I have often heard it remarked,
not only by our own countrymen, but by the
people here.”</p>

<p>“What do you think explains it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I am inclined to apply the theory
of M. Taine, the great French critic, to most
of the circumstances of life, and I should say
it was the climate; its uncertainty, its
<a name="png.039" id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>constant changes, the heaviness of the atmosphere,
the amount of fog, the real stress and
strain to live that results from trying physical
conditions added to the razor-sharp edge of
business and social competition and the close
contact that comes of packing forty millions
of people of pronounced individuality on an
island no bigger than the State of Georgia.
To my mind the wonder is that they behave
so well!”</p>

<p>Once, when I grew somewhat discouraged
and said that I had made no progress for a
day or two, my teacher told me that it was
just so when she learned: there were growing
days and stationary days, and she had
always noticed that just after one of these
last dull, depressing, and dubious intervals
she seemed to get an uplift and went ahead
better than ever. It was like a spurt in rowing.
This seems to be the law of progress
in everything we do; it moves along a spiral
rather than a perpendicular; we seem to be
actually going out of the way, and yet it
<a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>turns out that we were really moving upward
all the time.</p>

<p>One day, when my most expert trainer
twisted the truth a little that she might encourage
me, I was reminded of an anecdote.</p>

<p>In this practical age an illustration of the
workings of truthfulness will often help a
child more than any amount of exhortation
concerning the theory thereof. For instance,
a father in that level-headed part of the
United States known as “out West” found
that his little boy was falling into the habit of
telling what was not true; so he said to him
at the lunch-table, “Johnnie, I will come
around with a horse and carriage at four
o’clock to take you and mama for a drive this
afternoon.” The boy was in high spirits,
and watched for his father at the gate; but
the hours passed by until six o’clock, when
that worthy appeared walking up the street
in the most unconcerned manner; and when
Johnnie, full of indignation and astonishment,
asked him why he did not come as he
<a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had promised, the father said, “Oh, my boy,
I just took it into my head that I would
tell you a lie about the matter, just as you
have begun telling lies to me.” The boy began
to cry with mingled disappointment and
shame to think his father would do a thing
like that; whereupon the father took the little
fellow on his knee and said: “This has all
been done to show you what mischief comes
from telling what is not true. It spoils everybody’s
good time. If you cannot believe what
I say and I cannot believe what you say, and
nobody can believe what anybody says, then
the world cannot go on at all; it would have
to stop as the old eight-day clock did the
other day, making us all late to dinner. It
is only because, as a rule, we can believe in
one another’s word that we are able to have
homes, do business, and enjoy life. Whoever
goes straight on telling the truth helps
more by that than he could in any other one
way to build up the world into a beautiful
and happy place; and every time anybody
<a name="png.042" id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>tells what is not true he helps to weaken
everybody’s confidence in everybody else,
and to spoil the good time, not of himself
alone, but of all those about him.”</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>MY TEACHERS</h3>

<p>I studied my various kind teachers with
much care. One was so helpful that but for
my protest she would fairly have carried me
in her arms, and the bicycle to boot, the whole
distance. This was because she had not a
scintilla of knowledge concerning the machine,
and she did not wish me to come to grief
through any lack on her part.</p>

<p>Another was too timorous; the very twitter
of her face, swiftly communicated to her
arm and imparted to the quaking cross-bar,
convulsed me with an inward fear; therefore,
for her sake and mine, I speedily counted her
out from the faculty in my bicycle college.</p>

<div class="illo">
<a name="png.043" id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum"><span

 alt="[Illustration: “SO EASY—WHEN YOU KNOW HOW.”]" /><br
 /><span class="ns">    [Illustration: </span>“SO EASY—WHEN YOU KNOW HOW.”<span class="ns">]</span>
</div>

<p>Another (and she, like most of my teachers,
was a Londoner) was herself so capable, not to
<a name="png.045" id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>say adventurous, and withal so solicitous for
my best good, that she elicited my admiration
by her ingenious mixture of cheering me on
and holding me back; the latter, however,
predominated, for she never relinquished her
strong grasp on the cross-bar. She was a
fine, brave character, somewhat inclined to a
pessimistic view of life because of severe experience
at home, which, coming to her at a
pitifully early period, when brain and fancy
were most impressionable, wrought an injustice
to a nature large and generous—one
which under happier skies would have blossomed
out into a perfect flower of womanhood.
My offhand thinkings aloud, to which
I have always been greatly given, especially
when in genial company, she seemed to “catch
on the fly,” as a reporter impales an idea on
his pencil-point. We had no end of what
we thought to be good talk of things in
heaven and earth and the waters under the
earth; of the mystery that lies so closely
round this cradle of a world, and all the
<a name="png.046" id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>varied and ingenious ways of which the bicycle,
so slow to give up its secret to a care-worn
and inelastic pupil half a century old,
was just then our whimsical and favorite
symbol.</p>

<p>We rejoiced together greatly in perceiving
the impetus that this uncompromising but
fascinating and inimitably capable machine
would give to that blessed “woman question”
to which we were both devoted; for
we had earned our own bread many a year,
and she, although more than twenty years
my junior, had accumulated an amount of
experience well-nigh as great, because she
had lived in the world’s heart, or the world’s
carbuncle (just as one chooses to regard what
has been called in literary phrase the capital
of humanity). We saw that the physical development
of humanity’s mother-half would
be wonderfully advanced by that universal
introduction of the bicycle sure to come
about within the next few years, because it
is for the interest of great commercial
<a name="png.047" id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>monopolies that this should be so, since if women
patronize the wheel the number of buyers will
be twice as large. If women ride they must,
when riding, dress more rationally than they
have been wont to do. If they do this many
prejudices as to what they may be allowed to
wear will melt away. Reason will gain upon
precedent, and ere long the comfortable, sensible,
and artistic wardrobe of the rider will
make the conventional style of woman’s dress
absurd to the eye and unendurable to the understanding.
A reform often advances most
rapidly by indirection. An ounce of practice
is worth a ton of theory; and the graceful
and becoming costume of woman on the bicycle
will convince the world that has brushed
aside the theories, no matter how well constructed,
and the arguments, no matter how
logical, of dress-reformers.</p>

<p>A woman with bands hanging on her hips,
and dress snug about the waist and chokingly
tight at the throat, with heavily trimmed
skirts dragging down the back and numerous
<a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>folds heating the lower part of the spine, and
with tight shoes, ought to be in agony. She
ought to be as miserable as a stalwart man
would be in the same plight. And the fact
that she can coolly and complacently assert
that her clothing is perfectly easy, and that
she does not want anything more comfortable
or convenient, is the most conclusive proof
that she is altogether abnormal bodily, and
not a little so in mind.</p>

<p>We saw with satisfaction the great advantage
in good fellowship and mutual understanding
between men and women who take
the road together, sharing its hardships and
rejoicing in the poetry of motion through
landscapes breathing nature’s inexhaustible
charm and skyscapes lifting the heart from
what is to what shall be hereafter. We discoursed
on the advantage to masculine character
of comradeship with women who were
as skilled and ingenious in the manipulation
of the swift steed as they themselves. We
contended that whatever diminishes the sense
<a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of superiority in men makes them more manly,
brotherly, and pleasant to have about; we
felt sure that the bluff, the swagger, the bravado
of young England in his teens would not
outlive the complete mastery of the outdoor
arts in which his sister is now successfully
engaged. The old fables, myths, and follies
associated with the idea of woman’s incompetence
to handle bat and oar, bridle and rein,
and at last the cross-bar of the bicycle, are
passing into contempt in presence of the nimbleness,
agility, and skill of “that boy’s sister”;
indeed, we felt that if she continued to
improve after the fashion of the last decade
her physical achievements will be such that it
will become the pride of many a ruddy youth
to be known as “that girl’s brother.” As we
discoursed of life, death, and the judgment to
come, of “man’s inhumanity to man,” as well
as to beasts, birds, and creeping things, we
frequently recurred to a phrase that has become
habitual with me in these later years
when other worlds seem anchored close alongside
<a name="png.050" id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>this, and when the telephone, the phonograph,
and the microphone begin to show us
that every breath carries in itself not only the
power, but the scientific certainty of registration:
“Well, one thing is certain: we shall
meet it in the ether.”</p>

<p>One of my companions in the tribulation
of learning the bicycle, and the grace of its
mastery, was a tall, bright-faced, vigorous-minded
young Celt who is devoted to every
good word and work and has had much experience
with the “submerged tenth,” living
among them and trying to build character
among those waste places of humanity. I
set out to teach this young woman the bicycle,
and while she took her lesson—which,
as she is young, elastic, and long-limbed,
was vastly less difficult than mine—we talked
of many things: American women, and why
they do not walk; the English lower class,
and why they are less vigorous than the
Irish; the English girl of the slums, and why
she is less self-respecting than an Irish girl in
<a name="png.051" id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the same station. “There are many things
for which we cannot account,” said my young
friend; whereupon, with the self-elected mentorship
of my half-century, I oracularly observed:
“Cosmos has not a consequence
without a cause; it is the business of reason
to seek for causes, and, if it cannot make
sure of them, to construct for itself theories
as to what they are or will turn out to be
when found. But the trouble is, when we
have framed our theory, we come to look
upon it as our child, that we have brought
into the world, nurtured, and trained up by
hand. The curse of life is that men will
insist on holding their theories as true and
imposing them on others; this gives rise to
creeds, customs, constitutions, royalties, governments.
Happy is he who knows that he
knows nothing, or next to nothing, and holds
his opinions like a bouquet of flowers in his
hand, that sheds its fragrance everywhere,
and which he is willing to exchange at any
moment for one fairer and more sweet,
<a name="png.052" id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>instead of strapping them on like an armor of
steel and thrusting with his lance those who
do not accept his notions.”</p>

<p>My last teacher was—as ought to be the
case on the principle of climax—my best. I
think she might have given many a pointer
to folks that bring up children, and I realized
that no matter how one may think himself
accomplished, when he sets out to learn a
new language, science, or the bicycle he has
entered a new realm as truly as if he were a
child newly born into the world, and “Except
ye become as little children” is the law
by which he is governed. Whether he will
or not he must first creep, then walk, then
run; and the wisest guide he can have is the
one who most studiously helps him to help
himself. This was a truism that I had heard
all my life long, but never did a realizing sense
of it settle down upon my spirit so thoroughly
as when I learned the bicycle. It is not the
teacher who holds you in place by main
strength that is going to help you win that
<a name="png.055" id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>elusive, reluctant, inevitable prize we call success,
but it is the one who, while studiously
keeping in the background, steers you to the
fore. So No. 12 had the wit and wisdom to
retire to the rear of the saucy steed, that I
might form the habit of seeing no sign of aid
or comfort from any source except my own
reaction on the treadles according to law;
yet cunningly contrived, by laying a skilled
hand upon the saddle without my observation,
knowledge, or consent, to aid me in my
balancing. She diminished the weight thus
set to my account as rapidly as my own increasing
courage and skill rendered this possible.</p>

</div>

<p>I have always observed—and not without
a certain pleasure, remembering my brother’s
hardihood—that wherever a woman goes
some man has reached the place before her;
and it did not dim the verdure of my laurels
or the fullness of my content when I had
mastered Gladys to ascertain, from a letter
sent me by the wife of a man sixty-four
<a name="png.056" id="png.056" href="#png.056"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>46<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>years of age who had just learned, that I was
“No. 2” instead of “No. 1,” thus obliging
me to rectify the frontier of chronology as I
had constructed it in relation to the conquest
of the bicycle; for I vainly thought that I
had fought the antics of Gladys as a sentry
on duty away out on the extreme frontier of
time.</p>

<p>But at last (which means in two months or
thereabouts, at ten or twenty minutes’ practice
off and on daily) I reached the goal, and
could mount the bicycle without the slightest
foreign interference or even the moral support
of a sympathetic onlooker. In doing
this I realized that the totality of what I had
learned entered into the action. Every added
increment of power that I had gained in balancing,
pedaling, steering, taking advantage
of the surfaces, adjusting my weight according
to my own peculiarities, and so on, was
set to my account when I began to manage
the bulky steed that behaves worst of all
when a novice seeks the saddle and strikes
<a name="png.057" id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>out alone. Just so, I felt, it had been all my
life and will be, doubtless, in all worlds and
with us all. The totality of native forces and
acquired discipline and expert knowledge
stands us in good stead for each crisis that
we have to meet. There is a momentum, a
cumulative power on which we can count in
every new circumstance, as a capitalist counts
upon his credit at the bank. It is not only a
divine declaration, it is one of the basic laws
of being, that “all things work <em>together</em> for
good to them that love God”—that is, to
them that are in love with God; and he who
loves a law of God and makes himself obedient
to that law has by that much loved
God, only he does not always have the wit
to know it.</p>

<p>The one who has learned latest and yet
has really learned the mastery of the bicycle
is the best teacher. Many a time I have
heard boys in college say that it was not the
famed mathematician who could teach them
anything—he knew too much, he was too
<a name="png.058" id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>far ahead for them to hear his voice, he was
impatient of their halting steps; but the tutor
who had left college only the year before, and
remembering his own failures and stupidity,
had still that fellow-feeling that made him
wondrous kind.</p>

<p>As has been stated, my last epoch consisted
of learning to mount; that is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons asinorum</i>
of the whole mathematical undertaking, for
mathematical it is to a nicety. You have to
balance your system more carefully than
you ever did your accounts; not the smallest
fraction can be out of the way, or away you
go, the treacherous steed forming one half of
an equation and yourself with a bruised knee
forming the other. You must add a stroke
at just the right angle to mount, subtract one
to descend, divide them equally to hold your
seat, and multiply all these movements in
definite ratio and true proportion by the
swiftest of all roots, or you will become the
most minus of quantities. You must foot up
your accounts with the strictest regularity;
<a name="png.059" id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>there can be no partial payments in a business
enterprise like this.</p>

<p>Although I could now mount and descend,
turn corners and get over the ground all by
myself, I still felt a lack of complete faith in
Gladys, although she had never harmed me
but once, and then it was my own fault in
letting go the gleaming cross-bar, which is
equivalent to dropping the bridle of a spirited
steed. Let it be carefully remembered by
every “beginning” bicycler that, whatever
she forgets, she must forever keep her “main
hold,” else her horse is not bitted and will
shy to a dead certainty.</p>

<p>As we grew better acquainted I thought
how perfectly analogous were our relations to
those of friends who became slowly seasoned
one to the other: they have endured the vicissitudes
of every kind of climate, of the changing
seasons; they have known the heavy,
water-logged conditions of spring, the shrinkage
of summer’s trying heat, the happy medium
of autumn, and the contracting cold that
<a name="png.060" id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>winter brings; they are like the bits of wood,
exactly apportioned and attuned, that go to
make up a Stradivarius violin. They can
count upon one another and not disagree, because
the stress of life has molded them to
harmony. They are like the well-worn robe,
the easy shoe. There is no short road to this
adjustment, so much to be desired; not any
will win it short of “patient continuance in
well-doing.”</p>

<p>I noticed that the great law which I believe
to be potential throughout the universe made
no exception here: “According to thy faith
be it unto thee” was the only law of success.
When I felt sure that I should do my pedaling
with judicial accuracy, and did not permit
myself to dread the swift motion round a
bend; when I formed in my mind the image
of a successful ascent of the “Priory Rise”;
when I fully purposed in my mind that I
should not run into the hedge on the one side
or the iron fence on the other, these prophecies
were fulfilled with practical certainty.
<a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I fell into the habit of varying my experience
by placing before myself the image—so germane
to the work in which I am engaged—of
an inebriate in action, and accompanied this
mental panorama by an orchestral effect of
my own producing: “They reel to and fro,
and stagger like a drunken man;” but could
never go through this three consecutive times
without lurching off the saddle. But when I
put before me, as distinctly as my powers of
concentration would permit, the image of my
mother holding steadily above me a pair of
balances, and looking at me with that quizzical
expectant glance I knew so well, and saying:
“Do it? Of course you’ll do it; what else
should you do?” I found that it was palpably
helpful in enabling me to “sit straight
and hold my own” on my uncertain steed.
She always maintained, in the long talks we
had concerning immortality, that the law I
mention was conclusive, and was wont to close
our conversations on that subject (in which I
held the interrogative position) with some
<a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>such remark as this: “If Professor —— thinks
he is not immortal he probably is not; if I
think I am I may be sure I shall be, for is it
not written in the law, ‘According to thy
faith be it unto thee’?”</p>

<p>Gradually I realized a consoling degree of
mastery over Gladys; but nothing was more
apparent to me than that we were not yet
thoroughly acquainted—we had not summered
and wintered together. I had not
learned her kinks, and she was as full of
them as the most spirited mare that sweeps
the course on a Kentucky race-track. Although
I have seen a race but once (and that
was in the Champs Élysées, Paris, a quarter of
a century ago), I am yet so much interested
in the fact that it is a Flora Temple, a Goldsmith
Maid, a Maud S., a Sunol, a California
Maid that often stands first on the record, that
I would fain have named my shying steed after
one of these; but as she was a gift from Lady
Henry Somerset this seemed invidious in me
as a Yankee woman, and so I called her
<a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><i>Gladys</i>, having in view the bright spirit of the
donor, the exhilarating motion of the machine,
and the gladdening effect of its acquaintance
and use on my health and disposition.</p>

<p>As I have said, I found from first to last that
the process of acquisition exactly coincided
with that which had given me everything I
possessed of physical, mental, or moral success—that
is, skill, knowledge, character. I
was learning the bicycle precisely as I learned
the a-b-c. When I set myself, as a stint,
to mount and descend in regular succession
anywhere from twenty to fifty times, it was
on the principle that we do a thing more
easily the second time than the first, the third
time than the second, and so on in a rapidly
increasing ratio, until it is done without any
conscious effort whatever. This was precisely
the way in which my mother trained me to
tell the truth, and my music-teacher taught me
that mastership of the piano keyboard which
I have lost by disuse. Falling from grace
may mean falling from a habit formed—how
<a name="png.064" id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>do we know? This opens a boundless field
of ethical speculation which I would gladly
have followed, but just then the steel steed
gave a lurch as if to say, “Tend to your
knitting”—the favorite expression of a Rocky
Mountain stage-driver when tourists taxed
him with questions while he was turning
round a bend two thousand feet above the
valley.</p>

<p>And now comes the question “What do the
doctors say?” Here follow several testimonies:</p>

<p>“The question now of great interest to girls
is in regard to the healthfulness of the wheel.
Many are prophesying dire results from this
fascinating exercise, and fond parents are
refusing to allow their daughters to ride because
they are girls. It will be a delight to
girls to learn that the fact of their sex is, in
itself, not a bar to riding a wheel. If the
girl is normally constituted and is dressed
hygienically, and if she will use judgment
and not overtax herself in learning to ride,
<a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and in measuring the length of rides after she
has learned, she is in no more danger from
riding a wheel than is the young man. But
if she persists in riding in a tight dress, and
uses no judgment in deciding the amount of
exercise she is capable of safely taking, it will
be quite possible for her to injure herself, and
then it is she, and not the wheel, that is to
blame. Many physicians are now coming to
regard the ‘wheel’ as beneficial to the health
of women as well as of men.”</p>

<p>Dr. Seneca Egbert says: “As an exercise
bicycling is superior to most, if not all, others
at our command. It takes one into the outdoor
air; it is entirely under control; can be
made gentle or vigorous as one desires; is
active and not passive; takes the rider outside
of himself and the thoughts and cares
of his daily work; develops his will, his attention,
his courage and independence, and
makes pleasant what is otherwise most irksome.
Moreover, the exercise is well and
equally distributed over almost the whole
<a name="png.066" id="png.066" href="#png.066"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>body, and, as Parker says, when all the muscles
are exercised no muscle is likely to be
over-exercised.”</p>

<p>He advocates cycling as a remedy for dyspepsia,
torpid liver, incipient consumption,
nervous exhaustion, rheumatism, and melancholia.
In regard to the exercise for women
he says: “It gets them out of doors, gives
them a form of exercise adapted to their
needs, that they may enjoy in company with
others or alone, and one that goes to the root
of their nervous troubles.”</p>

<p>He instances two cases, of girls fourteen
and eighteen years of age, where a decided
increase in height could be fairly attributed to
cycling.</p>

 /><span class="ns">    [Illustration: </span>“LET GO—BUT STAND BY.”<span class="ns">]</span>
</div>

<p>The question is often asked if riding a wheel
is not the same as running a sewing-machine.
Let the same doctor answer: “Not at all.
Women, at least, sit erect on a wheel, and
consequently the thighs never make even a
right angle with the trunk, and there is no
stasis of blood in the lower limbs and
<a name="png.069" id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>genitalia. Moreover, the work itself makes the
rider breathe in oceans of fresh air; while
the woman at the sewing-machine works indoors,
stoops over her work, contracting the
chest and almost completely checking the
flow of blood to and from the lower half of
her body, where at the same time she is increasing
the demand for it, finally aggravating
the whole trouble by the pressure of the
lower edge of the corset against the abdomen,
so that the customary congestions and
displacements have good cause for their existence.”</p>

<p>“The great desideratum in all recreations
is pure air, plenty of it, and lungs free to absorb
it.” (Dr. Lyman B. Sperry.)</p>

<p>“Let go, but stand by”—this is the golden
rule for parent and pastor, teacher and friend;
the only rule that at once respects the individuality
of another and yet adds one’s own,
so far as may be, to another’s momentum in
the struggle of life.</p>

<p>How difficult it is for the trainer to judge
<a name="png.070" id="png.070" href="#png.070"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>exactly how much force to exercise in helping
to steer the wheel and start the wheeler
along the macadamized highway! In this
the point of view makes all the difference.
The trainer is tall, the rider short; the first
can poise on the off-treadle while one foot
is on the ground, but the last must learn to
balance while one foot is in the air. For
one of these perfectly to comprehend the
other’s relation to the vehicle is practically
impossible; the degree to which he may attain
this depends upon the amount of imagination
to the square inch with which he has
been fitted out. The opacity of the mind,
its inability to project itself into the realm of
another’s personality, goes a long way to explain
the friction of life. If we would set
down other people’s errors to this rather than
to malice prepense we should not only get
more good out of life and feel more kindly
toward our fellows, but doubtless the rectitude
of our intellects would increase, and the
justice of our judgments. For instance, it is
<a name="png.071" id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>my purpose, so far as I understand myself, to
be considerate toward those about me; but
my pursuits have been almost purely mental,
and to perceive what would seem just to one
whose pursuits have been almost purely mechanical
would require an act of imagination
of which I am wholly incapable. We are so
shut away from one another that none tells
those about him what he considers ideal
treatment on their part toward him. He
thinks about it all the same, mumbles about
it to himself, mutters about it to those of his
own guild, and these mutterings make the
discontent that finally breaks out in reforms
whose tendency is to distribute the good
things of this life more equally among the
living. But nothing will probe to the core
of this the greatest disadvantage under which
we labor—that is, mutual non-comprehension—except
a basis of society and government
which would make it easy for each to
put himself in another’s place because his
place is so much like another’s. We shall be
<a name="png.072" id="png.072" href="#png.072"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>less imaginative, perhaps, in those days—the
critics say this is inevitable; but it will only
be because we need less imagination in order
to do that which is just and kind to every
one about us.</p>

<p>In my early home my father always set us
children to work by stints—that is, he measured
off a certain part of the garden to be
weeded, or other work to be done, and when
we had accomplished it our working-hours
were over. With this deeply ingrained habit
in full force I set myself stints with the bicycle.
In the later part of my novitiate fifty attempts
a day were allotted to that most difficult of all
achievements, learning to mount, and I calculate
that five hundred such efforts well
put in will solve that most intricate problem
of specific gravity.</p>

<p>Now concerning falls: I set out with the
determination not to have any. Though
mentally adventurous I have always been
physically cautious; a student of physiology
in my youth, I knew the reason why I
<a name="png.073" id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>brought so much less elasticity to my task
than did my young and agile trainers. I
knew the penalty of broken bones, for these
a tricycle had cost me some years before.
My trainers were kind enough to encourage
me by saying that if I became an expert in
slow riding I should take the rapid wheel as
a matter of course and thus be really more
accomplished (in the long run as well as the
short) than by any other process. So I have
had but one real downfall to record as the
result of my three months’ practice, and it
illustrates the old saying that “pride goeth
before destruction, and a haughty spirit before
a fall”; for I was not a little lifted up by
having learned to dismount with confidence
and ease—I will not say with grace, for at
fifty-three that would be an affectation—so
one bright morning I bowled on down the
Priory drive waving my hand to my most
adventurous aide-de-camp, and calling out
as I left her behind, “Now you will see
how nicely I can do it—watch!” when
<a name="png.074" id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>behold! that timid left foot turned traitor, and
I came down solidly on my knee, and the
knee on a pebble as relentless as prejudice
and as opinionated as ignorance. The nervous
shock made me well-nigh faint, the bicycle
tumbled over on my prone figure, and
I wished I had never heard of Gladys or of
any wheel save</p>

<p class="noindent">of my release into the ether.</p>

<p>Let me remark to any young woman who
reads this page that for her to tumble off her
bike is inexcusable. The lightsome elasticity
of every muscle, the quickness of the eye, the
agility of motion, ought to preserve her from
such a catastrophe. I have had no more falls
simply because I would not. I have proceeded
on a basis of the utmost caution, and
aside from that one pitiful performance the
bicycle has cost me hardly a single bruise.</p>

<p>They that know nothing fear nothing.
Away back in 1886 my alert young friend,
Miss Anna Gordon, and my ingenious young
niece, Miss Katharine Willard, took to the
tricycle as naturally as ducks take to water.
The very first time they mounted they went
spinning down the long shady street, with its
pleasant elms, in front of Rest Cottage, where
for nearly a generation mother and I had had
our home. Even as the war-horse snuffeth
the battle from afar, I longed to go and do likewise.
Remembering my country bringing-up
and various exploits in running, climbing,
horseback-riding, to say nothing of my tame
heifer that I trained for a Bucephalus, I said
to myself, “If those girls can ride without
learning so can I!” Taking out my watch
I timed them as they, at my suggestion, set
out to make a record in going round the
square. Two and a half minutes was the result.
I then started with all my forces well
<a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in hand, and flew around in two and a quarter
minutes. Not contented with this, but puffed
up with foolish vanity, I declared that I would
go around in two minutes; and, encouraged
by their cheers, away I went without a fear
till the third turning-post was reached, when
the left hand played me false, and turning at
an acute angle, away I went sidelong, machine
and all, into the gutter, falling on my
right elbow, which felt like a glassful of
chopped ice, and I knew that for the first
time in a life full of vicissitudes I had been
really hurt. Anna Gordon’s white face as
she ran toward me caused me to wave my
uninjured hand and call out, “Never mind!”
and with her help I rose and walked into the
house, wishing above all things to go straight
to my own room and lie on my own bed,
and thinking as I did so how pathetic is that
instinct that makes “the stricken deer go
weep,” the harmed hare seek the covert.</p>

<p>Two physicians were soon at my side, and
my mother, then over eighty years of age,
<a name="png.077" id="png.077" href="#png.077"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>came in with much controlled agitation and
seated herself beside my bed, taking my hand
and saying, “O Frank! you were always too
adventurous.”</p>

<p>Our family physician was out of town, and
the two gentlemen were well-nigh strangers.
It was a kind face, that of the tall, thin man
who looked down upon me in my humiliation,
put his ear against my heart to see if
there would be any harm in administering
ether, handled my elbow with a woman’s
gentleness, and then said to his assistant,
“Now let us begin.” And to me who had
been always well, and knew nothing of such
unnatural proceedings, he remarked, “Breathe
into the funnel—full, natural breaths; that is
all you have to do.”</p>

<p>I set myself to my task, as has been my
wont always, and soon my mother and my
friend, Anna Gordon, who were fanning me
with big “palm-leaves,” became grotesque
and then ridiculous, and I remember saying
(or at least I remember that I once
<a name="png.078" id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>remembered), “You are a couple of enormous crickets
standing on your hind legs, and you have
each a spear of dry grass, and you look as
if you were paralyzed; and you wave your
withered spears of grass, and you call that
fanning a poor woman who is suffocating
before your eyes.” I labored with them, entreated
them, and dealt with them in great
plainness—so much so that my mother could
not bear to hear me talk in such a foolish
fashion, and quietly withdrew to her own
room, closed the door, and sat down to possess
her soul in patience until the operation
should be over.</p>

<p>Then the scene changed, and as they put
on the splints pain was involved, and I heard
those about me laughing in the most unfeeling
manner while I murmured: “She always
believed in humanity—she always said she
did and would; and she has lived in this town
thirty years, and they are hurting her—they
are hurting her dreadfully; and if they keep
on she will lose her faith in human nature,
<a name="png.079" id="png.079" href="#png.079"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and if she should it will be the greatest calamity
that can happen to a human being.”</p>

<p>Now the scene changed once more—I was
in the starry heavens, and said to the young
friends who had come in and stood beside
me: “Here are stars as thick as apples on a
bough, and if you are good you shall each
have one. And, Anna, because you <em>are</em>
good, and always have been, you shall be
given a whole solar system to manage just as
you like. The Heavenly Father has no end
of them; He tosses them out of His hand as
a boy does marbles; He spins them like a
cocoon; He has just as many after He has
given them away as He had before He
began.”</p>

<p>Then there settled down upon me the
most vivid and pervading sense of the love
of God that I have ever known. I can give
no adequate conception of it, and what I said,
as my comrades repeated it to me, was something
after this order:</p>

<p>“We are like blood-drops floating through
<a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the great heart of our Heavenly Father. We
are infinitely safe, and cared for as tenderly
as a baby in its mother’s arms. No harm
can come anywhere near us; what we call
harm will turn out to be the very best and
kindest way of leading us to be our best
selves. There is no terror in the universe,
for God is always at the center of everything.
He is love, as we read in the good book, and
He has but one wish—that we should love
one another; in Him we live, and move, and
have our being.”</p>

<p>Little by little, freeing my mind of all sorts
of queer notions, I came back out of the
only experience of the kind that I have ever
known; but I must say that had I not learned
the great evils that result from using anesthetics
I should have wished to try ether
again, just for the ethical and spiritual help
that came to me. It let me out into a new
world, greater, more mellow, more godlike,
and it did me no harm at all.</p>

<p>During the time my arm was in a sling I
<a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“sat about”—something not easy to do for
one of active mind and life. I learned to
write with my left hand—for this was before
the happy days of the many stenographers—and
my hieroglyphics went out to all the
leading temperance women of this country.
One morning the bell, distant and musical,
tolled in the steeple of the university. We
knew it meant that General Grant was dead,
for the newspapers and despatches of the
previous evening had prepared us. Somehow
a deep chord in my soul vibrated to the
tone of the bell—a chord of patriotism—and I
went away to the vine-covered piazza, where
I was wont to sit, and in twenty minutes
(which fact is my apology for their limping
feet) wrote out my heart in the following lines.
They had at least the merit of sincere devotion,
and were telephoned to Chicago, eleven
miles away, by Anna Gordon, and appearing
in the daily <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite> were read at their
breakfast-tables by many other patriots next
morning. I do not know when anything has
<a name="png.082" id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>given me more real pleasure than to be told
that a stalwart soldier belonging to the Grand
Army of the Republic read my crude but
heartfelt lines aloud to his wife and daughter,
and at the close brushed away a manly tear.</p>

<h3>IN CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>If I am asked to explain why I learned the
bicycle I should say I did it as an act of grace,
if not of actual religion. The cardinal doctrine
laid down by my physician was, “Live out of
doors and take congenial exercise;” but from
the day when, at sixteen years of age, I was
enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded
every footstep, I have detested walking and
felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions
of life had cut me off from what in
the freedom of my prairie home had been
one of life’s sweetest joys. Driving is not
real exercise; it does not renovate the river
of blood that flows so sluggishly in the veins
of those who from any cause have lost the
natural adjustment of brain to brawn. Horseback-riding,
which does promise vigorous exercise,
is expensive. The bicycle meets all
<a name="png.087" id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the conditions and will ere long come within
the reach of all. Therefore, in obedience to
the laws of health, I learned to ride. I also
wanted to help women to a wider world, for
I hold that the more interests women and
men can have in common, in thought, word,
and deed, the happier will it be for the home.
Besides, there was a special value to women in
the conquest of the bicycle by a woman in
her fifty-third year, and one who had so many
comrades in the white-ribbon army that her
action would be widely influential. Then
there were three minor reasons:</p>

<p>I did it from pure natural love of adventure—a
love long hampered and impeded, like
a brook that runs underground, but in this
enterprise bubbling up again with somewhat
of its pristine freshness and taking its merry
course as of old.</p>

<p>Second, from a love of acquiring this new
implement of power and literally putting it
underfoot.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, because a good many
people thought I could not do it at my age.</p>

<p><a name="png.088" id="png.088" href="#png.088"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>It is needless to say that a bicycling costume
was a prerequisite. This consisted of
a skirt and blouse of tweed, with belt, rolling
collar, and loose cravat, the skirt three inches
from the ground; a round straw hat, and
walking-shoes with gaiters. It was a simple,
modest suit, to which no person of common
sense could take exception.</p>

<p>As nearly as I can make out, reducing the
problem to actual figures, it took me about
three months, with an average of fifteen minutes’
practice daily, to learn, first, to pedal;
second, to turn; third, to dismount; and
fourth, to mount independently this most
mysterious animal. January 20th will always
be a red-letter bicycle day, because although
I had already mounted several times with no
hand on the rudder, some good friend had
always stood by to lend moral support; but
summoning all my force, and, most forcible
of all, what Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson
declares to be the two essential elements—decision
and precision—I mounted and started
<a name="png.089" id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>off alone. From that hour the spell was
broken; Gladys was no more a mystery: I
had learned all her kinks, had put a bridle in
her teeth, and touched her smartly with the
whip of victory. Consider, ye who are of a
considerable chronology: in about thirteen
hundred minutes, or, to put it more mildly,
in twenty-two hours, or, to put it most mildly
of all, in less than a single day as the almanac
reckons time—but practically in two days of
actual practice—amid the delightful surroundings
of the great outdoors, and inspired
by the bird-songs, the color and fragrance of
an English posy-garden, in the company of
devoted and pleasant comrades, I had made
myself master of the most remarkable, ingenious,
and inspiring motor ever yet devised
upon this planet.</p>
